# Introduction
This is a framework for running PF1e and OGL (3.5e) RPG games in MapTool 1.8.3 and above.

# 3.5e Is Not Currently Supported, But Will Be Soon
If you want to run a 3.5e game, you'll have to ignore the PF1e part, i.e. Combat Maneuvers.  Also, Hero Lab(R) is only supported for PF1e characters, but I am hoping to add 3.5e support soon.

# Other RPG Game Systems Might Be Supported With This Framework
If you play 5e or PF2e, consider taking this framework and starting a project.  Most of the initial hard work has been done -- just please comply with my license agreement.  I put a lot of hours into this over a period of about a year and a half.

# Future Releases Of This Framework
I enjoy working on this framework, though because I am currently running campaigns that involve flying, levitation, and terrain elements such as hills, trees, forests, valleys, depressions, sink holes, cliffs, rivers, things under water, etc., I cannot run my campaigns effectively with MapTool, even though MapTool remains my favorite VTT.  I have requested feature #2004.  Therefore, this situation slows me down with respect to doing additional releases for this framework.

Just as I said above.  If you want to take this framework and start your own project because I am just too slow with your feature or bug fix requests, go for it -- just please respect my license agreement because I put a huge amount of time into this.  Thank you!

# Project Description

I apologize for the lightweight nature of my postings.

This project will be for managing a D&D 3.5 or Pathfinder 1e campaign in MapTool with features such as below, has been under nearly two years of development, and has been used by my group now for nearly the past two years:

- Party Treasure management
- Campaign management (view activity logs for each token so no more questions about how many spells or which spells were cast since last resting, how many arrows were used, how many charges were used, etc.)
- Campaign Time tracking (you'll now be able to deal with complex issues such as PCs crafting while the party moves on to further adventures)
- Automatic spell DC calculations
- Spell management (complete for both prepared and spontaneous spell casters)
- Easy to use interface
- Easy to understand macro layout
- Resource tracking (equipment, ranged attacks, spells, special abilities, money, etc.)
- New skills can be added by the GM (and they are automatically made available to all the tokens)
- Adjustments due to conditions or spells cast for abilities, size, movement, saving throws, energy resistance, AC, attacks, skills, light sources, etc. are automatically applied and can be enabled/disabled outright or based on whether their duration is rounds, minutes, or hours.
- Manage adjustments as reuseable templates for conditions, spells, and light sources.
- "Character Sheet" makes reviewing PCs and NPCs easy -- can be used in conjunction with WinMerge to do a text-based comparison for the old token's sheet versus the new token's sheet.
- "Player Token Editor.cmpgn" enables players to edit their tokens offline.
- Characters can give each other equipment items.
- Manage money.
- Resting automatically restores spells, hit points, daily use items and special abilities, expires adjustments with a temporary duration, etc.
- Import most PC and NPC details from Hero Lab(R).
- And more ...

This framework has been used in regular game play by our group and enhanced periodically since December 2018 -- and might be easily modifiable to support other game systems such as PF2e, 5e, etc.

Hero Lab(R) is a registered trademark of Lone Wolf Development.

Note: I forgot to release the "Player Token Editor.cmpgn". Will do that in the next release. You could make one yourself from the current release, but hang on and I'll give you one soon.

Note: This release can be used with 3.5e -- but it was developed for PF1e. So, for example, Hero Lab(R) can currently only be used with PF1e characters. I'm planning to add 3.5e support soon.
