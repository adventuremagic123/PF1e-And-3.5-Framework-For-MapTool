# Introduction
This is a framework for running PF1e and OGL (3.5e) RPG games in MapTool 1.8.3 and above.

# 3.5e Is Not Currently Supported, But Will Be Soon
If you want to run a 3.5e game, you'll have to ignore the PF1e part, i.e. Combat Maneuvers.

# Other RPG Game Systems Might Be Supported With This Framework
If you play 5e or PF2e, consider taking this framework and starting a project.  Most of the initial hard work has been done -- just please comply with my license agreement.  I put a lot of hours into this over a period of about a year and a half.

# Future Releases Of This Framework
I enjoy working on this framework, though because I am currently running campaigns that involve flying, levitation, and terrain elements such as hills, trees, forests, valleys, depressions, sink holes, cliffs, rivers, things under water, etc., I cannot run my campaigns effectively with MapTool, even though MapTool remains my favorite VTT.  I have requested feature #2004.  Therefore, this situation slows me down with respect to doing additional releases for this framework.

Just as I said above.  If you want to take this framework and start your own project because I am just too slow with your feature or bug fix requests, go for it -- just please respect my license agreement.  Also, as I said, I put a huge amount of time into this.
